**Size** Bootstrap is larger, with a minified file size of around 140 KB, while Tailwind CSS is lighter, with a minified file size of approximately 39 KB (using core plugins). This can impact loading times and performance, especially on slower networks.

**Community Support** Bootstrap has been around longer and has a more extensive community with numerous resources, including themes, components, and learning materials. Tailwind CSS, though newer, has been gaining popularity, and its community support and resources are increasing rapidly.

**SEO** Neither Bootstrap nor Tailwind CSS has a significant impact on SEO. The key to good SEO is proper usage of semantic HTML elements, and both frameworks can work well when used correctly.

**Performance** Bootstrap offers good performance on both mobile and desktop devices, with responsive design built-in. Tailwind CSS, due to its smaller size and modular approach, provides excellent performance on both mobile and desktop devices.

**Integration** Both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS can be integrated well with Next.js and a WordPress-based content source. There are multiple starter templates available for both frameworks, which can simplify the integration process.

**Unique Advantages** Bootstrap offers a rich set of pre-built components, thorough documentation, and built-in responsive design. This can help speed up development for an affiliate website. Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, provides a highly customizable, utility-first approach, which results in a smaller file size and a more modular, scalable solution. This can be beneficial for affiliate websites that require fine-grained control over styling and performance.
